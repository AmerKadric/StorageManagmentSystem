In this project, I developed a storage management system using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The application allows users to load, create, and display storage items. Each storage item is associated with a unique itemID, and the system stores information such as product name, quantity, first name, last name, phone number, and email. The program features buttons to load previous products from a CSV file, create new items, show the stored items, find a specific item by itemID, and display the most recent items in reverse order. Additionally, I implemented functionalities for reading and writing data to a CSV file, ensuring persistent storage across sessions. The GUI is designed using Tkinter, providing a user-friendly interface for efficient interaction with the storage management system.
